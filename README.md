# Compounding Example

Here have three example for scalable interest calculation and rewards distrbution. The idea is mainly come for this research paper [Scalable Reward Distribution on the Ethereum Blockchain](http://batog.info/papers/scalable-reward-distribution.pdf)

\*Warning: these files is not ready for production yet, as efficiency and security still needed to be improved.

### Share.sol
This file show the algorithm of normal rewards distribution as presented by the research paper.

### ShareCompounding.sol
This file show the algorithm of compounding rewards distribution, where the rewards will be auto staked for getting next rewards.

### InterestCompounding.sol
This file show scalable interest calculation.
